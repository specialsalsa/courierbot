# courierbot

This is a custom Discord bot made in discord.js for the Couriers Discord server. Currently it has a few simple commands but will be extended to include a ticketing/verification system as well as anything else I might like to add.

This project is to benefit the Couriers server, and serves as a way for me to familiarize myself with discord.js, node.js, and JavaScript overall. So please be nice if you notice any glaring problems. :^)
